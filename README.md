# Tee (C#)
An implementation of the POSIX tee program, written in C# as a demonstration of my knowledge Test Driven Development & programing in C#.
## Future work
This program is mostly done, all it needs is unix signal handling, & it should be ready for release.
I would additionally like to add test that run the compiled program itself.
I do not know how to do either of these.
## Command line parsing
While I hand-rolled my cmd argument parsing, I am using the rust clap library for help in writing the help str.
Hopefully this may be changed or done by the program itself in the future.
