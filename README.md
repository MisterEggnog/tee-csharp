# Tee (C#)
An implementation of the POSIX tee program, written in C# as a demonstration of my knowledge Test Driven Development & programing in C#.
## Future work
This program is mostly done, all it needs is unix signal handling, & it should be ready for release.
I would additionally like to add test that run the compiled program itself.
I do not know how to do either of these.
